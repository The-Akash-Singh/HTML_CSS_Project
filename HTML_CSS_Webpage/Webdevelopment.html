			<h1>Romentic</h1>
			<p>All art (painting, music, drama etc.) during this period is considered to be of a 'Romantic' style. There is no supremely clear definition of this term, but one may consider it thus: A period in cultural history where art (and most notably music) began to grasp emotion and imaginative idea as its roots, rather than the heavily standardized rules and formulas of Classicism which had existed directly before - in the 18th century.</p>

			<h1>DJ Parties</h1>
			<p>The practice of modern "real time" disc jockey mixing was preceded by radio personalities who introduced and played individual selections of recorded music on broadcast radio stations.[1] In 1935, American radio commentator Walter Winchell coined the term "disc jockey" (the combination of disc, referring to the disc records, and jockey, which is an operator of a machine) as a description of radio announcer Martin Block, the first radio announcer to gain widespread fame for playing popular recorded music over the air.</p>

			<h1>Love Birds</h1>
			<p>A love song is a song about romantic love, falling in love, heartbreak after a breakup, and the feelings that these experiences bring. A comprehensive list of even the best known performers and composers of love songs would be a large order.

Love songs can be found in a variety of different music genres.</p>
